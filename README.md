# gift-shop-holiday-sales
A PHP page that displays 5 items available for sale at a gift shop.  The items that are displayed are to the next holiday that is coming up.  In order to determine which holiday is coming up the program extracts the server date and use comparisons to upcoming dates of holidays to select the appropriate products to show. 

The entire page is a PHP page.  Page also computes the number of days (hours, minutes, and seconds) left until the holiday... kind of like a countdown clock.
